**"Humans use available information as well as reason in order to solve problems and make decisions, so why can’t machines do the same thing?"**
— *Alan Turing, computer science pioneer*

As Turing suggested, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to emulate human intelligence—to learn, reason, and act in ways that resemble how we do.

But here’s the key point:
AI is *not* here to replace humans. Rather, it is designed to *augment* human capabilities. The goal is collaboration, not substitution.

AI operates through mathematics and logic. It learns from data and identifies patterns within it to make predictions or decisions.

The concept of AI was first formally introduced in 1956. While that was nearly 70 years ago, the field has only seen explosive growth in recent years—especially in the 2020s. Why? Primarily due to earlier limitations in computing power and data availability—both of which are critical to AI development. Today, thanks to the rise of big data and powerful computational resources, AI is progressing at an unprecedented pace.

AI encompasses a wide range of subfields. Two of the most well-known are **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)**.

* **Machine learning** refers to a machine’s ability to learn from data and improve its performance over time—all without being explicitly programmed for each task.

* **Deep learning**, a more advanced branch of ML, is based on **artificial neural networks (ANNs)**. These networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain, consisting of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information in increasingly abstract ways.

Other major areas within AI include **computer vision** (enabling machines to "see" and interpret visual information), **natural language processing (NLP)** (which allows machines to understand and generate human language), **generative AI** (which creates new content such as text, images, or music), **robotics**, and many more.
